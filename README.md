# Cafe

Cafe is a tiny single header game framework/engine


Cafe is basically a wrap to other single header modules (that you can use as single libs in your projects)

- [Tea](https://github.com/cafe-engine/tea): Render, Window and Input modules
- [Mocha](https://github.com/cafe-engine/mocha): Audio module
- [Coffee](https://github.com/cafe-engine/coffee): Lisp based language

TODO:
- [Latte]: Filesystem and Packaging modules
- [Milk]: UI module
